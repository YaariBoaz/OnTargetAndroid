As a user of this plugin,\n * you will have to register listeners to changes happening to the products\n * you register.\n *\n * The core of the listening mechanism is the `when()` method. It allows you to\n * be notified of changes to one or a set of products using a query mechanism:\n * ```typescript\n *  this.store.when(\"product\").updated(refreshScreen); // match any product\n *  this.store.when(\"full_version\").owned(unlockApp); // match a specific product\n *  this.store.when(\"subscription\").approved(serverCheck); // match all subscriptions\n *  this.store.when(\"downloadable content\").downloaded(showContent);\n * ```\n *\n * The `updated` event is fired whenever one of the fields of a product is\n * changed (its `owned` status for instance).\n *\n * This event provides a generic way to track the statuses of your purchases,\n * to unlock features when needed and to refresh your views accordingly.\n *\n * ## Registering products\n *\n * The store needs to know the type and identifiers of your products before you\n * can use them in your code.\n *\n * Use `store.register()` to define them before your first call to `store.refresh()`.\n *\n * Once registered, you can use `store.get()` to retrieve an `IAPProduct` object.\n *\n * ```typescript\n *  this.store.register({\n *    id: \"my_consumable1\",\n *    type: this.store.CONSUMABLE\n *  });\n *  ...\n *  const p = this.store.get(\"my_consumable1\");\n * ```\n *\n * The product `id` and `type` have to match products defined in your\n * Apple, Google or Microsoft developer consoles.\n *\n * Learn more about it [from the wiki](https://github.com/j3k0/cordova-plugin-purchase/wiki).\n *\n * ## Displaying products\n *\n * Right after you registered your products, nothing much is known about them\n * except their `id`, `type` and an optional `alias`.\n *\n * When you perform the initial call to `store.refresh()`, the platforms' server will\n * be contacted to load informations about the registered products: human\n * readable `title` and `description`, `price`, etc.\n *\n * This isn't an optional step, store owners require you\n * to display information about a product exactly as retrieved from their server: no\n * hard-coding of price and title allowed! This is also convenient for you\n * as you can change the price of your items knowing that it'll be reflected instantly\n * on your clients' devices.\n *\n * Note that the information may not be available when the first view that needs\n * them appears on screen. For you, the best option is to have your view monitor\n * changes made to the product.\n *\n * ## Purchasing\n *\n * #### initiate a purchase\n *\n * Purchases are initiated using the `store.order(\"some_product_id\")` method.\n *\n * The store will manage the internal purchase flow. It'll end:\n *\n *  - with an `approved` event. The product enters the `APPROVED` state.\n *  - with a `cancelled` event. The product gets back to the `VALID` state.\n *  - with an `error` event. The product gets back to the `VALID` state.\n *\n * See the product life-cycle section for details about product states.\n *\n * #### finish a purchase\n *\n * Once the transaction is approved, the product still isn't owned: the store needs\n * confirmation that the purchase was delivered before closing the transaction.\n *\n * To confirm delivery, you'll use the `product.finish()` method.\n *\n * #### example usage\n *\n * During initialization:\n * ```typescript\n * this.store.when(\"extra_chapter\").approved((product: IAPProduct) => {\n *   // download the feature\n *   app.downloadExtraChapter()\n *   .then(() => product.finish());\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * When the purchase button is clicked:\n * ```typescript\n * this.store.order(\"extra_chapter\");\n * ```\n *\n * #### un-finished purchases\n *\n * If your app wasn't able to deliver the content, `product.finish()` won't be called.\n *\n * Don't worry: the `approved` event will be re-triggered the next time you\n * call `store.refresh()`, which can very well be the next time\n * the application starts. Pending transactions are persistant.\n *\n * #### simple case\n *\n * In the most simple case, where:\n *\n *  - delivery of purchases is only local ;\n *  - you don't want (or need) to implement receipt validation ;\n *\n * You may just want to finish all purchases automatically. You can do it this way:\n * ```js\n * this.store.when(\"product\").approved((p: IAPProduct) => p.finish());\n * ```\n *\n * NOTE: the \"product\" query will match any purchases (see \"queries\" to learn more details about queries).\n *\n * ## Receipt validation\n *\n * To get the most up-to-date information about purchases (in case a purchase have been canceled, or a subscription renewed),\n * you should implement server side receipt validation.\n *\n * This also protects you against fake \"purchases\", made by some users using\n * \"free in-app purchase\" apps on their devices.\n *\n * When a purchase has been approved by the store, it's enriched with\n * transaction information (see `product.transaction` attribute).\n *\n * To verify a purchase you'll have to do three things:\n *\n *  - configure the validator.\n *  - call `product.verify()` from the `approved` event, before finishing the transaction.\n *  - finish the transaction when transaction is `verified`.\n *\n * **Shameless Plug**: this is a feature many users struggle with, so as the author of this plugin, we can provide it to you as-a-service: https://billing.fovea.cc/\n * (which is free until you start making serious money)\n *\n * #### example using a validation URL\n *\n * ```js\n * this.store.validator = \"https://billing.fovea.cc/\";\n *\n * this.store.when(\"my stuff\")\n *   .approved((p: IAPProduct) => p.verify())\n *   .verified((p: IAPProduct) => p.finish());\n * ```\n *\n * ## Subscriptions\n *\n * For subscription, you MUST implement remote receipt validation.\n *\n * When the receipt validator returns a `store.PURCHASE_EXPIRED` error code, the subscription will\n * automatically loose its `owned` status.\n *\n * Typically, you'll enable and disable access to your content this way.\n * ```typescript\n * this.store.when(\"my_subcription\").updated((product: IAPProduct) => {\n *   if (product.owned)\n *     app.subscriberMode();\n *   else\n *     app.guestMode();\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ## Product life-cycle\n *\n * A product will change state during the application execution.\n *\n * Find below a diagram of the different states a product can pass by.\n *\n * ```\n * REGISTERED +--> INVALID\n *            |\n *            +--> VALID +--> REQUESTED +--> INITIATED +-+\n *                                                       |\n *                 ^      +------------------------------+\n *                 |      |\n *                 |      |             +--> DOWNLOADING +--> DOWNLOADED +\n *                 |      |             |                                |\n *                 |      +--> APPROVED +--------------------------------+--> FINISHED +--> OWNED\n *                 |                                                             |\n *                 +-------------------------------------------------------------+\n *\n * #### Notes\n *\n *  - When finished, a consumable product will get back to the `VALID` state, while other will enter the `OWNED` state.\n *  - Any error in the purchase process will bring a product back to the `VALID` state.\n *  - During application startup, products may go instantly from `REGISTERED` to `APPROVED` or `OWNED`, for example if they are purchased non-consumables or non-expired subscriptions.\n *  - Non-Renewing Subscriptions are iOS products only.
